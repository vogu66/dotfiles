# This is the emergency slow computer page

# DIAGNOSTIC THE SYSTEM
# iotop and htop are nice
# faster though:
vmstat 1 3

# IF memory -> free is very low, you're lacking RAM
# No emergency response for now
# May consider adding SWAP file
# You need to kill stuff, though:
pkill <stuff>
pkill -9 <stuff> # force killing
killall -I <stuff>
killall -I -9 <stuff> # force killing
killall -y 5m # kills everything you launched in the last 5 min

# if IO has high numbers -- lots of read/write on the disk
# if CPU -> id at 0, your cpu is overloaded

# you may consider killing the process and maybe check
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Improving_performance
# to assign background priority in the future
