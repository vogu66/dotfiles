# To lowercase all files and folders in current directory:
rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *

# To replace 'sometext' with 'replacedby' in all files in current directory:
rename 's/sometext/replacedby/' *

# from manual:

Given the files foo1, ..., foo9, foo10, ..., foo278, the commands

    rename foo foo00 foo?
    rename foo foo0 foo??

will turn them into foo001, ..., foo009, foo010, ..., foo278.  And

    rename .htm .html *.htm

will fix the extension of your html files.  Provide an empty string for
shortening:

    rename '_with_long_name' '' file_with_long_name.*

will remove the substring in the filenames.
